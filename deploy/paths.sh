# Both scripts run as root, and both turn a path — from the command line, or
# from an env file somebody edited months ago — into the target of mkdir,
# chown, a recursive chmod, and in one case rsync --delete. A wrong path is
# therefore not a misconfiguration to be corrected on the next run; it is a
# directory that no longer contains what it did. Everything here is a check
# to run before the first write.

# The canonical form of a path: trailing slashes gone, "." and ".." resolved
# as far as the path exists, symlinks followed. Comparing the strings alone
# let "/opt/footnote/" through a check that "/opt/footnote" would have
# failed, and a symlink through both.
